===============

About
-----
Just a little C++/Qt library to command Samsung Smart TVs via IP. The repository contains a class to command the TV via IP and a little Widget interface to test it.
As it's made with Qt it works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Just recompile for your favorite OS.

Install
-------
You need Qt4 (should work just fine if compiled with Qt5).
You can get the SDK here: http://qt-project.org/downloads
